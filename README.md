## 🍪 How to Extract Facebook Cookies (Chrome & Firefox) and Use Them with the Script

### Step 1: Install EditThisCookie Extension
- Install [EditThisCookie] on your browser:
  - [Chrome Web Store link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/editthiscookie-v3/ojfebgpkimhlhcblbalbfjblapadhbol)
  - [Firefox Add-ons link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/editthiscookie-lastest-edition/)
- The extension is available for both Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

**Screenshot:**

### Step 2: Log in to Facebook
- Open your browser (Chrome or Firefox) and log in to the Facebook account you want to use.

**Screenshot:**
![Log in to Facebook](docs/screenshots/login_facebook.png)

### Step 3: Extract Cookies Using EditThisCookie
1. Click the EditThisCookie icon next to the address bar.
2. A window will appear showing all cookies for facebook.com.
3. Click the "Export" button or the copy icon to copy all cookies as text.
4. Paste the cookies into a text editor (like Notepad or VSCode) for temporary storage.

**Screenshot:**
![Open EditThisCookie and Export Cookies](docs/screenshots/export_cookies.png)

### Step 4: Convert Cookies to JSON Format for the Script
- The script requires cookies in a file named `cookies.json` in this format:
```json
[
  {"name": "c_user", "value": "123456789", "domain": ".facebook.com", "path": "/", "secure": true},
  {"name": "xs", "value": "abcdefg", "domain": ".facebook.com", "path": "/", "secure": true},
  {"name": "fr", "value": "example_value", "domain": ".facebook.com", "path": "/", "secure": true}
  // ... more cookies ...
]
```
- You can use online tools to convert the cookie string to JSON, or edit it manually (each cookie is an object `{}` separated by commas).
- The most important cookies: `c_user`, `xs`, `fr`, `datr`, `sb` (but it's best to include all cookies).

**Screenshot:**
![Example cookies.json file](docs/screenshots/cookies_json_example.png)

### Step 5: Save Cookies in cookies.json
- Save the cookies in a file named `cookies.json` in the same folder as the script.
- Make sure the file starts with `[` and ends with `]`, and each cookie is inside `{}` and separated by commas.

**Screenshot:**
![cookies.json in project folder](docs/screenshots/cookies_json_in_folder.png)

### ⚠️ Important Notes:
- Cookies are valid for a limited time (if they expire or you log out, repeat the steps).
- **Never share your cookies with anyone else!**
- All cookies must be for the same Facebook account.

  - `my_friend_account.txt`: Add your own or your friend's Facebook profile URL (if you want to report as "A friend").
